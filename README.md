# Contribution
One of the ways one can contribute is by creating their own repository, using this (and/or other related ones) as a dependence. Monkey-patch can be used if one needs to integrate a module inside the same class tree used here.
The software architecture was planned taking that into account, providing clear interface-classes to guide the implementer, and several levels of niceties across the repositories to avoid an excess of functionalities being inherited.

# History
With the exception of dependencies like sklearn and others, the novel ideias presented here are a result of a years-long process of drafts, thinking, trial/error and rewrittings from scratch in several languages from Delphi, passing through Haskell, Java and Scala to Python. The fundamental concepts were lightly borrowed from basic category theory concepts like algebraic data structures that permeate many recent tendencies in programming language design, data flow specification, among others. 

For code (and academic) details refer to the following projects (few of them are usable by now):
